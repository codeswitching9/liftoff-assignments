# Project Outline
For this assignment, you will submit a high-level outline of your project. This can, and likely will, change over time. In particular, your mentor will provide direction and feedback to help sharpen your ideas. So don't worry if you feel unsure about some aspects of the outline or if you have to change some things later.

### Overview
Being intrigued by the strange and unusual doesn't have to be fictional. You no longer have to imagine being able to visit creepy and haunted locations because you can now encounter the supernatural yourself with Get Weird!

The Get Weird app allows you to keep track of supernatural sightings on a map. Your personal experiences can be brought to life by keeping track of your visits through location ratings and reviews. 

### Features
* User login: Users will be able to create an account and profile.
* Search: Users can complete searches for specific supernatural entities or locations.
* Reviews/Ratings: Users can leave a review and rating about experiences at specific locations.
* Favorites: Users can add a location as a favorite and view in a list.
* To be visited list: Users can add a location that they wish to visit to a list.
* Already visited list: Users can add previously visited locations to a list.

### Technologies
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* C#
* ASP.NET Core
* MySQL
* Google Maps API

### What I'll Have to Learn
* The main thing that I will need to learn is finding an appropriate API and implementing it. Our project will rely heavily on a map feature so whatever will help us to achieve allow users to view sites/events on a map is essential.
* How to create a review/rating system
* Adding appropriate CSS to make the app visually pleasing and intuitive for users
